## About Me

I am a medical laboratory science graduate with a strong focus on research-minded thinking, scientific rigor, and clear communication. My background combines biomedical science with science communication and technical writing, allowing me to operate comfortably between laboratory concepts, data-driven reasoning, and public-facing explanation.

My primary intellectual interests lie in genetics, bioinformatics, and the philosophy of science—especially philosophy of biology. I am particularly interested in how emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence are reshaping scientific research, knowledge production, and healthcare practice.

I treat learning as a long-term, structured process rather than a short-term goal. My current direction emphasizes computational skill development, applied projects, and conceptual depth rather than superficial breadth.

## What You’ll Find Here

This GitHub profile is an active workspace rather than a static portfolio. Repositories may include:

- Python scripts and learning-oriented tools  
- Bioinformatics practice projects and experiments  
- Structured notes on scientific or philosophical topics  
- Projects connecting science, writing, and technology  

Some repositories are exploratory by design. I value transparency in learning and iterative improvement over premature polish.

---

## Current Focus

- Strengthening foundations in bioinformatics and computational biology  
- Developing practical Python-based projects relevant to biomedical science  
- Studying philosophy of science with emphasis on biology and genetics  
- Exploring practical uses of AI in research, education, and science communication  

---

## Long-Term Direction

My long-term aim is to work at the intersection of science, computation, and communication—contributing to research-informed projects, educational initiatives, or tools that improve how scientific knowledge is produced, evaluated, and communicated.
